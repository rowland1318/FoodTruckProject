## Food Truck Project

###Overview

This program is a Food Truck Application that asks the user to input up to five Food Trucks as well as their type of food and the rating they give the truck. Once the user enters all five Food Trucks they are given a menu display with options to list out the food trucks that they entered, calculate the average rating of the trucks, display the highest rated truck, or quit the application. If the user enters less than 5 Food then they are immediately presented the menu options that will do the same work but with less trucks.
